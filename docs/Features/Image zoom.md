To turn off image zoom open [[Style Settings]] plugin, then go to `Minimal › Images › Disable image zoom`

## Obsidian Publish support

Image zoom can also be enabled with [[Minimal for Obsidian Publish]] by using the `img-zoom` [[Helper classes|helper class]]. Requires adding code to your `publish.js` file. See the related guide, [[Create an image gallery for Obsidian Publish]].
